Hi everyone! 

As my new year's resolution, I created this blog using github to delve into my areas of interest, digital speech processing and computer networks. Once a month, I'll discuss a paper regarding these areas. Occasionally, I'll post about my side projects as well-[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about) I did last year, how I made this blog using [github](https://pages.github.com), etc. 

I am excited about this blog and hope you are, too!
