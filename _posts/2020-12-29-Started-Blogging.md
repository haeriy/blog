Hi everyone! 

As my new year's resolution, I created this blog using github to delve into my areas of interest, digital speech processing and computer networks. Once a month, I'll discuss a paper regarding these areas. Occasionally, I'll post about my side projects as well- <a href=https://adventofcode.com/2020/about/>Advent of Code</a> I did last year, how I made this blog using <a href=https://pages.github.com/>github</a>, etc. 

I am excited about this blog and hope you are, too!
